Problem: Elvis had a twin brother who died at birth.   
What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin?   
Assume we observe the following probabilities in the population:   
P(fraternal twin) = 1/125   
P(identical twin) = 1/300

Solution:   
fraternal = Elvis had a fraternal twin   
identical = Elvis had an identical twin   
twin = Elvin had a twin brother

P(identical/twin) = ?   
P(identical/twin) = P(identical)P(twin/identical) / P(twin)


Solving the top part of the equation:   
P(identical)P(twin/identical) = (1/300)(1/2) = 0.0017

Solving the bottom part of the equation:   
P(twin) = P(fraternal)P(twin/fraternal) + P(identical)P(twin/identical)   
P(twin) = (1/125)(1/4) + (1/300)(1/2) = 0.0037


**P(identical/twin) = 0.0017/0.0037 = 0.45**
