In a Bayesian approach, we model the data probabilistically as well as the parameters
associated with the distribution of the data.
In a Frequentist approach, we only model the data probabilistically, but not the parameters.

Let's say I want to estimate average height in inches for all adult males in the US.
If I use a Bayesian approach, my answer might be something like, there is a 95%
probability that the population height is between 60 and 85 inches (given the data I observed).

If I use a Frequentist approach, my answer might be something like, with 95% confidence
base on the data I observed, the population height is between 60 and 85 inches.
