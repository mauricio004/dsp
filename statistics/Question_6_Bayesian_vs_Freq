n lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> A list stores an ordered collection of elements and a set stores an unordered collection of unique elements.
Regarding performance, sets are faster when we want to find an object in a set.  When searching for objects in sets, the speed of this operation does not depend 
on the size of the set like for lists. Lists are faster when we iterate over their content.  
For example, we can have the following list:  
lst = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]  
Now, we want to create a set from this list:  
st = set(lst)  
The new set contains {1, 2, 3}
